        Hi. I am a third year undergraduate at the
        <a href="https://www.umass.edu" target="_blank">University of Massachussetts at Amherst</a>.
        I am studying computer science in the
        <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu" target="_blank">Manning College of Information and Computer Science</a>
        and am particularly interested in systems programming.
    </p>
    This website contains the work I have done during my time at UMass Amherst, as well as projects
    that I have worked on in my free time.
