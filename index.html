        Hello! I am a third year undergraduate at the
        <a href="https://www.umass.edu" target="_blank">University of Massachussetts at Amherst</a>.
        I am studying computer science at the
        <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu" target="_blank">Manning College of Information and Computer Science</a>
        and am particularly interested in systems programming and artificial intelligence.
        This website contains the work I have done during my time at UMass Amherst, as well as projects
        that I have worked on in my free time.
